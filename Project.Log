ADA Chip-8 Emulator
===================

----------

- In order to simplify things, the first version of this project will include
the ROM (chip-8 program to be executed) in the emulator binary. To do this we
will need to generate a ``.ads`` file which exports a symbol containing the binary
data of the ROM (for example an aggregate of chars...).

- In order to draw on the screen we will need to use the Ada Drivers Library.
